# Object-Detection-and-Multi-Object-Classification
# Object Detection and Multi-Object Classification for Underwater Plastic Detection

🌊♻️ A deep learning-based project to detect and classify multiple plastic objects underwater using object detection techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project addresses the problem of detecting **plastic waste in underwater environments**.  
We perform **object detection** and **multi-object classification** to accurately identify and localize various types of plastics submerged underwater.

The project aims to contribute toward **marine environment protection** by enabling automated plastic waste detection systems.

## 📚 Libraries and Frameworks

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

*(Optional: Add YOLOv5 / Faster R-CNN if used for detection.)*

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Underwater Plastic Waste Dataset** (public dataset or custom collected images)  
- Multiple classes including:
  - Plastic Bags
  - Bottles
  - Wrappers
  - Other Plastic Objects

*(You can edit this part if you used a specific dataset like "Plastic Waste in Marine Environment Dataset" from Kaggle.)*

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Install the required libraries:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Open the Colab Notebook:

Open underwater_plastic_detection.ipynb in Google Colab.

Upload the dataset if required.

Run all cells sequentially.

Training and Evaluation:

Train the object detection model on underwater plastic images.

Evaluate detection performance: Precision, Recall, mAP (mean Average Precision), etc.

📊 Results

Metric	Value (example)
Detection Accuracy	92%
mAP (mean Average Precision)	88%
Classification Accuracy	90%
(Replace these with your actual experiment results.)

🎯 Features
